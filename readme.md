<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Another project for the r-ArgentinaPrograma course, instructed by Fabricio Sodano, initiated from a Reddit initiative. The goal of this project was to fetch data from a currency base using an API and present the results in an organized and user-friendly way on an HTML table. Beyond that, the user has the capability to select a historic date to do the fetch and convert a value to all the currencies listed on the table. One of the key features of this project is that the user has the capability to select a specific historic date to do the fetc. In addition, the user can also convert a value to any of the currencies listed on the table, making this project quite practical and useful.
